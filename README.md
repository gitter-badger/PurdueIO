This is a WIP iOS application for Purdue.io. It utilizes `Purdue.io`'s API to gather JSON data.


## Dependencies

- Cocoapods - can be installed by running `sudo gem install cocoapods`
- AFNetworking - fetched via Cocoapods

## How To Install

Installation is simple. `cd` into the directory containing the `.xcodeproj` file (from the command line), and run `pod install`. Cocoapods will automatically fetch and build AFNetworking. After installing, open and use the `.xcworkspace` file for working on the project.

Here's a really shit GIF of it working:
